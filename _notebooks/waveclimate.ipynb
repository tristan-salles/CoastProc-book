    "Waves are a defining characteristic of water-bodies worldwide, transporting energy that impacts numerous physical and ecological processes. Since World War II, there has been a substantial increase in scientific understanding of wave formation, propagation and resulting impacts on coastal and marine features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial wave studies were restricted to data from voluntary ship observations, which were limited in accuracy and sample size, particularly during extreme conditions. The development of technology such as wave buoys has provided accurate, hourly data of wave height, period and direction. This data enables almost immediate knowledge of the **sea state**, which is the present wave conditions."

    "## Wave records in Australia\n",
    "\n",
    "In Australia, waves have been officially recorded since 1974 with the deployment of the first Waverider buoy in Port Kembla, New South Wales ([Hemer et al. 2007](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26481627?seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents)). This was the start of an increasing network of *buoys*, *High-Frequency radars* and other wave measurement technology leading to significant knowledge of wave dynamics around the Australian coastline. A further technological leap in wave monitoring was achieved in 1985, with the launch of the [GEOSAT](https://earth.esa.int/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/g/geosat) satellites with a mounted *altimeter*. As a remote sensing technique, altimeters provide wave data observations with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution ([Ribal & Young 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0083-9)). Long-term analysis of wave conditions can lead to the characterisation of a wave climate, which is the modal wave conditions of an area ([Godoi et al. 2016](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2015JC011572)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Variation from the modal wave climate can occur due to *extreme events* such as large **storms**, **Tropical Cyclones** (TC) or **tsunamis**. For Australia, it is critical to understand these extreme conditions and to analyse their role in ecological disturbance, as well as to predict present and future vulnerability, particularly with anthropogenic climate change likely to increase the frequency of intense TCs along our coasts.\n",

    "![images/bom_wave.jpg](images/bom_wave.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "The wave climate of a region is further impacted by **climate oscillations**, which are semi-regular cyclical changes that have well-defined effects on regional and global weather patterns. These fluctuations typically influence atmospheric temperature, sea surface temperature, wind or precipitation. Oscillations operate on different timescales and can therefore occur together, enhancing or diminishing the effects of each event ([Godoi et al. 2019](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/joc.5823)). A key example is the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (**ENSO**), which plays an integral role in climate modulation over the Pacific Ocean and surrounding continents. Both the Australian modal and extreme wave climates can be substantially influenced by these climate oscillations, primarily due to changes in wind patterns and changes to extreme event frequency and intensity."

    "\n",
    "Ocean waves are formed by different mechanisms and as a result, can have a wide range of properties. In this course, we focus on **ocean surface gravity waves** (henceforth referred to as waves), also known as *wind-generated waves*.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the atmosphere-ocean interface, kinetic wind energy is transferred to the ocean, which with sufficient wind, generate waves ([Holthuijsen 2007](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/waves-in-oceanic-and-coastal-waters/F6BF070B00266943B0ABAFEAE6F54465)). Several factors influence wave formation, including the *strength* and *duration* of the wind, and the *fetch*, the distance over open ocean which the wind blows.\n",
    "\n",
    "When wind blows over only a short distance, wind-waves are formed. In Australia, these locally-generated waves typically have a short period of **1-8 s**, and travel slower than the prevailing wind. In contrast, swell-waves are generated by distant storms and have propagated out of the wave-generation area. Swell has a longer period of **8-30 s**, and is only minimally influenced by local wind conditions. In many instances, these two wave types occur simultaneously and can travel in opposite directions, creating chaotic seas.\n",

    "### Wave Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Waves can be characterised by parameters such as *wave period*, *height*, *power* and *direction*. Distinctions between different wave classes are based on these measurements and are used to describe both individual waves and the wave climate of a region.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vertical distance between the maximum and minimum surface elevation over one wave period is referred to as **wave height** ([Holthuijsen 2007](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/waves-in-oceanic-and-coastal-waters/F6BF070B00266943B0ABAFEAE6F54465)). To define the overall wave height of many waves, typically the significant wave height is calculated ($ H_{s} $). Mathematically, $ H_{s} $ is the mean of the highest third of waves in a given sample period ([Holthuijsen 2007](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/waves-in-oceanic-and-coastal-waters/F6BF070B00266943B0ABAFEAE6F54465)); traditionally, it is the height a trained observer would see when attempting to estimate average wave height, as humans would not see or consider the smallest waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "![images/hstz.jpg](images/hstz.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Wave period** is the time for one full wavelength to pass a given point, from the beginning to the end of the wave ([Holthuijsen 2007](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/waves-in-oceanic-and-coastal-waters/F6BF070B00266943B0ABAFEAE6F54465)).\n",
    "Usually, the zero-crossing period is used ($ T_{z} $) that measures the time for a wave to go below the mean elevation, rise above, then return to mean elevation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As waves propagate across the ocean surface, energy is also transferred, referred to as **wave power** ($ P $) or **wave energy flux**. The $ P $ of each wave is proportional to the $ T_{z} $ and the square of $ H_{s} $, with higher values producing more powerful waves (Airy 1841). This parameter is important as it combines both $ H_{s} $ and $ T_{z} $, providing an overall understanding of the wave conditions and the energy it transports. For example, a wave with a $ H_{s} $ of 1 m and $ T_{z} $ of 5 s will have less power than a wave with an $ H_{s} $ of 1m and $ T_{z} $ of 8 s.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Propagation direction** ($ \\theta $) is the direction from which waves are coming from. In certain regions a particular wave direction can indicate different swell characteristics, for example, large waves from the South-East in Queensland, Australia, indicate strong Southern Ocean swell or Extra-Tropical Cyclone swell, whilst large waves from the north indicate Tropical Cyclone waves."

Buoys also provide the most reliable and accurate records, particularly for extreme values.

    "Wave hindcast models use **reanalysed wind fields** to investigate **past** waves. Wind speed and duration are required parameters that are calculated alongside fetch and water depth to determine $ H_{s} $, $ T_{z} $ and $ \\theta $. This provides data sets that are used globally to establish wave climate and can evaluate conditions at different temporal and spatial scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "A widely used wave hindcast is the *National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration* (NOAA) **WaveWatch III model** ([Tolman 2009](https://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/mmab/papers/tn276/MMAB_276.pdf)) as shown in the introduction to this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, significant problems can arise through error with forced wind condition. For example, extreme events such as TCs can cause abrupt, localised changes to wind speed and direction. Since models such as **WaveWatch III** have relatively coarse spatial-temporal resolution, insufficient energy from wind is inputted leading to significant underestimation of wave conditions during these extreme events. The accuracy of the hindcast model is also dependent of additional source term parameters and generation, propagation and dissipation equations.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Note**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">In Australia, this is a significant problem in reef areas, where wave propagation is modified substantially by reefs. With coarse spatial detail, identification and accounting for reefs are reduced, thus leading to potentially incorrect wave conditions in areas sheltered by reefs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, whilst wave hindcast models can provide excellent information of wave conditions, particularly in areas where there are no buoys, inherent limitations regarding spatial detail and reliance on source terms means that it is currently unsuitable for wave climate characterisation for reef or areas with complicated bathymetry."

    "In contrast, the **La Nina phase is linked to higher wave energy on the Eastern Australian coastline and more extreme storms**.\n",

    "In New Zealand, increased $ H_{s} $ occurs during both of the ENSO extreme phases, resulting in increased coastal and marine operational risk alongside potential changes to biological and physical marine processes.\n",

    ">\n",
    ">Climate change is predicted to bring more frequent and extreme ENSO events of both phases, which could lead to atypical wave conditions. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the historical impacts of ENSO on wave climate to predict the future conditions for marine and coastal vulnerability globally.\n",

    "The **SAM**, also known as the **Antarctic Oscillation**, is the principal mode of variability in the Southern Hemisphere extra-tropics and high latitudes. The SAM controls the north and south movement of the westerly wind belt that circulates Antarctica and is measured by the difference in zonal mean sea level pressure between 40S and 65S. SAM phases can significantly influence wave height and directional variability, influencing the entire Pacific Ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "- During the **positive phase**, the wind belt contracts towards Antarctica and is often **correlated to stable, dry conditions in Australia**.  \n",
    "- In the negative phase, the belt expands north and can lead to **increased storm frequency and precipitation in Australia and New Zealand** [Godoi et al. 2016](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2015JC011572)).  "

Oscillations can also enhance or detract the effects of other oscillations, leading to complex interactions and influence on both atmospheric and wave climate."

    "Long-term observational data sets of beach profile variability and underlying trends that have been measured regularly and uninterrupted for several decades are very rare. Only a few sites around the world have sustained routine decadal-scale monitoring of the coastline, with notable examples that include the US Army Corps of Engineers Field Research Facility in the United States, the Hazaki Oceanographical Research Station in Japan, and Narrabeen-Collaroy Beach in Australia ([http://www.narrabeen.wrl.unsw.edu.au](http://www.narrabeen.wrl.unsw.edu.au)).\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Note**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">These unique data sets are critical for understanding how beaches respond to processes over a range of time scales, including storms that last hours to days, inter-annual climatic cycles such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and longer-term processes such as mean sea level rise. This type of knowledge is essential for predictive modelling and for making appropriate coastal management and planning decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this practical is to utilise online resource of beach profile data from Narrabeen-Collaroy Beach in New South Wales, Australia, to assess how the subaerial beach and the shoreline position vary (1) **spatially due to alongshore-variable wave conditions**, and (2) **over multiple time scales in response to changing wave conditions and climate cycles**."
