It is therefore critical to observe and quantify changes along coastlines vulnerable to extreme as well as subtle changes in oceanographic forcing."

The capacity of sandy dunes to provide coastal hazard protection depends in large part on their geometry.\n",

However, recent improvements in coastal monitoring technologies (such as optical, Lidar, and satellite remote sensing), have resulted in a significant increase in coastal topographic data, for which analysis by an expert is infeasible.
