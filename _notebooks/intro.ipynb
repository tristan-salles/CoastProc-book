    "1. a *web-based programming platform* based on **Jupyter notebooks** that contains all the materials for the **exercises** and **practicals**.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Over the last 20 years, major improvements in our understanding of coastal\n",
    "processes have been related to (1) easier access to observational dataset and (2) improved\n",
